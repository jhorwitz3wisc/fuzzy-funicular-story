There once was a man named Dave who lived in Brooklyn, New York. 
Every day, Dave would get up before sunrise, and take the elevator down to the lobby of his building.
From there, he would walk out into the street, and begin his job of collecting trash. Dave was good at his job, so good that the streets would sparkle when he was done.
Dave's boss was so happy with his work that he recommended Dave to a city wide competition for being the best citizen in the city.
Being good friends with Dave's boss, the mayor awarded him the city wide award for being a good citizen.
However, Dave had a dark secret that no one knew about.
