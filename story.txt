There once was a man named Dave who lived in Brooklyn, New York. 
Every day, Dave would get up before sunrise, and take the elevator down to the lobby of his building.
From there, he would walk out into the street, and begin his job of collecting trash. Dave was good at his job, so good that the streets would sparkle when he was done.
Dave's boss was so happy with his work that he recommended Dave to a city wide competition for being the best citizen in the city.
Being good friends with Dave's boss, the mayor awarded him the city wide award for being a good citizen.
However, Dave had a dark secret that no one knew about.
If you ever saw him working, you would find him surrounded by his many friends. "Friends" is what he called them. You could hear him crooning in a dark alley, "Hurry up friends, the sun is about to rise, we don't want to be seen, do we?". With a flurry of movement, several tiny hands begin shoving trash into bags. Soon every piece of trash has been collected. With the sun just about to rise, it's time to go back, only to return the next day.
One day, one of Dave's coworkers decided to follow him. He wanted to know what made Dave so good at his job. So he decides to stalk Dave, only to find out Dave's dark secret. It was in fact rats, who dave called his "friends" who were hard at work, cleaning the streets while Dave was asleep. But Dave's coworker lets it slide, and to this day no knows Dave's perfect little sectret.
