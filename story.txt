There once was a man named Dave who lived in Brooklyn, New York. 
Every day, Dave would get up before sunrise, and take the elevator down to the lobby of his building.
From there, he would walk out into the street, and begin his job of collecting trash. Dave was good at his job, so good that the streets would sparkle when he was done.
